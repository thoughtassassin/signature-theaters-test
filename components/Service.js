          <p>
            After a free consultation to determine the scope, budget requirements,
            and timeline of your project, we will submit a to-the-dollar proposal 
            complete with schematic drawings and blueprints tailored to your personal
            preferences. Design revisions continue until the system perfectly compliments 
            your home and fulfills all of your A/V and home automation needs.

          <h2>Installation</h2>
          <p>
            After an agreement is made on a design, we use our 25 years of experience
            and Cedia Certified professionals to insure that ever install is done as 
            if it were our home.  We know what makes a great installation are the 
            little things that our clients will likely never see.  Our clientâ€™s 
            satisfaction is the most important part of this process.

            Establishing long term personal relationships with our clients
            after the install through years of unfailing support is the key
            to our success.  Using remote troubleshooting access and service 
            contracts, we monitor and update your system remotely, heading 
            off any potential problems, and doing what we do best: making 
            sure your system performs as it should.
