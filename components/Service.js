          <p>
            Our systems begin with a free consultation to determine the scope,
            budget requirements, and timeline of your project.  We will then
            submit a detailed to-the-dollar proposal complete with schematic
            drawings and blueprints custom tailored to your personal needs and
            preferences. Then, we will submit as many revisions as is necessary
            to make sure that you are getting exactly the system you want.
            Here at Signature Theaters, we don’t do cookie cutters, we design
            custom systems that will perfectly compliment your home and fulfill
            all of your A/V and home automation needs.

          <h2>Installation</h2>
          <p>
            Signature Theaters has been providing the Permian Basin
            with custom home installation of quality  products since 2008.
            Everyone here at Signature Theaters strongly believes that our
            client’s satisfaction is the most important part of our services.
            We do every installation as if it were our home and our equipment.
            We know that what truly makes a great installation are the little
            things that our clients will likely never see.  With 25 years of
            experience and Cedia Certified professionals at your service,
            custom home automation is a call away.
